<div align="center">
<h1>webConsole</h1>
<p>💻 a terminal on the web without ttyd</p>
</div>
run your favourite commands and manage your server online with this thing
<br>
it's easy to set up and easy to use 😉
<br>
<br>

## Usage
currently, the app only supports commands that output to `stdout` (so that means it won't be able of running commands that need input)
<br>
but anyways, you're still able to do cool stuff with it, like, well, nothing else rather than accessing your server from the web
<br>
i'll keep updating the app, but for now, look at this cool demo screenshot:

hehehe

## Setting up webConsole

**step 1**: install node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download), again, if you already have installed it, proceed to next step
<br>
<br>
**step 2**: run `npm ci` (this will install every library the program needs)
<br>
<br>
**step 3**: run `node main.js`
<br>
after doing this, you should be able to see the program live on `http://localhost:3000`, try running commands with it later!
